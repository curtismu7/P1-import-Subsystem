## Notes
- User wants the version widget centered in the footer.
- Remove the old version number from the image/footer area.
- Ensure version 6.1 is displayed everywhere (UI, Swagger, etc)
- Logging for critical events must include version 6.1
- Add a version widget for Swagger UI at the top
- Combined log now has a human-readable readable.log for tail -f
- Swagger UI readability improved with high-contrast light theme
- Main app UI buttons are unresponsive after restart
- Token status API returns correct status; widget should now work
- Token status widget is confirmed working after both API and UI fixes have been implemented
- logs/readable.log does not exist after restart (confirmed missing despite Winston config)
- App is stuck on startup screen; initialization never completes
- Startup screen bug fixed; main UI is now visible and responsive (UI working)
- At startup, app should check for stored credentials and prompt user to use them or go to settings (now implemented and integrated into app startup)
- readable.log path issue fixed in Winston config, but file still not created at runtime
- Regression: Disclaimer modal does not appear and all main UI buttons are unresponsive after readable.log fix. Credential flow and app initialization broken.
- Regression fixed: Main UI is now responsive, disclaimer modal restored, credential flow integration reverted and JS errors fixed.
- User does not see any changes in the browser; fixes may not be taking effect or are not visible.
- Root cause: Multiple browser pages were open while the server was down, causing persistent connection errors in the browser. User must reload after server is running.
- Disclaimer modal still does not appear after all other fixes; modal functionality must be investigated and restored.
- Disclaimer modal now forced to always show for debugging; bundle rebuilt with fix. Confirm if modal appears as expected.
- Disclaimer modal is now working as expected.
- Credentials modal (startup credentials prompt) is not appearing; needs investigation and restoration.
- Credentials modal now forced to always show for debugging; bundle rebuilt with fix. Confirm if modal appears as expected.
- Both modals still do NOT appear even with forced logic; deeper systematic debugging of modal loading/execution is required.
- Root cause: Modal JS files were not imported in app.js and thus not bundled; imports restored and bundle rebuilt, so modals should now appear.
- Modals confirmed to load in fresh browser tab; browser cache/state can prevent execution if opened while server is down.
- Modals still do NOT appear in main UI even though bundle loads and app initializes; further investigation needed if modal display is required for next steps.
- Root cause: Disclaimer modal initialization was waiting for DOMContentLoaded, but the bundle executes after DOM is loaded, so the event never fired. Initialization refactored to execute immediately; modals should now display on app load.
- Modals now display, but main app buttons are still unresponsive after modal flow; further debugging of app initialization and UI interactivity required.
- Main app UI/button interactivity after modal flow now fixed: event listeners implemented for navigation and actions; duplicate navigation listeners removed so ViewManagementSubsystem handles navigation; bundle rebuilt and buttons should now be responsive.
- Root cause of unresponsive buttons: Both NavigationSubsystem and ViewManagementSubsystem were running simultaneously, causing navigation conflicts. NavigationSubsystem disabled via feature flag (USE_NAVIGATION_SUBSYSTEM: false) to use only ViewManagementSubsystem; bundle rebuilt and navigation should now work properly.
