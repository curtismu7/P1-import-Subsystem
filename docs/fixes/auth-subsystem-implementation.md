# Authentication Subsystem Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the PingOne Authentication Subsystem, which addresses several issues with the previous authentication mechanism:

1. **Inconsistent Credential Handling**: Credentials were stored in multiple locations without proper synchronization
2. **Insecure Storage**: API secrets were stored in plain text in some locations
3. **Poor Token Management**: Token retrieval and refresh logic was duplicated and inconsistent
4. **Tight Coupling**: Authentication logic was tightly coupled with other components

## Implementation Details

### 1. Subsystem Isolation

Created a standalone authentication subsystem with clear API boundaries:

- **Server API**: `/api/v1/auth/*` endpoints in `auth-subsystem/server/index.js`
- **Client API**: `PingOneAuth` class in `auth-subsystem/client/index.js`

This isolation protects the authentication logic from changes in other components and provides a consistent interface for authentication services.

### 2. Secure Credential Storage

Implemented secure credential storage in multiple locations:

- **Server**: `data/settings.json` with AES-256-CBC encryption
- **Client**: LocalStorage with Web Crypto API encryption
- **Environment Variables**: Support for configuration via environment variables

The encryption keys are stored in the `AUTH_SUBSYSTEM_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable, with fallback mechanisms for development environments.

### 3. Token Management

Implemented robust token management with:

- **Automatic Token Refresh**: Tokens are refreshed before expiration
- **Token Caching**: Tokens are cached in memory to reduce API calls
- **Retry Logic**: Failed token requests are retried with exponential backoff
- **Concurrent Request Handling**: Multiple concurrent token requests are handled efficiently

### 4. Credential Consistency

Implemented mechanisms to ensure credential consistency:

- **Validation Endpoint**: `/api/v1/auth/validate-credentials` endpoint to validate credentials
- **Synchronization**: Credentials are synchronized between server and client storage
- **Clear-Text Display**: Credentials are displayed in clear text on the settings page

### 5. Token Retrieval at Startup

Implemented automatic token retrieval at application startup:

- **Server Startup**: Token is retrieved during server startup using environment variables or settings file
- **Client Startup**: Token is retrieved during client application initialization
- **Retry Logic**: Failed token requests are retried with exponential backoff

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests:
