# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The PingOne Import Tool currently handles population-related API interactions in a scattered manner across multiple files, making it difficult to maintain and extend. This specification outlines the requirements for a new `PopulationService` subsystem that will centralize all population-related API interactions, providing a robust, maintainable, and future-proof solution.

The `PopulationService` will be responsible for fetching populations, retrieving individual populations by ID, populating UI dropdowns, and managing population data caching. It will be integrated with the existing authentication and API client systems, and will be used by various components of the application that need to interact with population data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized service for all population-related API interactions, so that I can maintain and extend population functionality more easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application needs to fetch all populations THEN the `PopulationService` SHALL provide a method to retrieve them
2. WHEN the application needs to fetch a specific population by ID THEN the `PopulationService` SHALL provide a method to retrieve it
3. WHEN the application needs to populate a dropdown with population data THEN the `PopulationService` SHALL provide a method to do so
4. WHEN the application needs to clear cached population data THEN the `PopulationService` SHALL provide a method to do so
5. WHEN the `PopulationService` is instantiated THEN it SHALL accept dependencies via dependency injection
6. WHEN the `PopulationService` makes API calls THEN it SHALL use the provided API client
7. WHEN the `PopulationService` needs authentication THEN it SHALL use the provided token manager

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize population data retrieval, so that the application performs efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `PopulationService` fetches population data THEN it SHALL cache the results in memory
2. WHEN the `PopulationService` is asked for population data it has already fetched THEN it SHALL return the cached data instead of making a new API call
3. WHEN the cache needs to be invalidated THEN the `PopulationService` SHALL provide a method to clear the cache
4. WHEN an API call fails THEN the `PopulationService` SHALL handle the error gracefully and provide a meaningful error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update existing code to use the new `PopulationService`, so that all population-related API interactions are centralized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `PopulationManager` needs to fetch populations THEN it SHALL use the `PopulationService` instead of making direct API calls
2. WHEN the `PopulationManager` needs to initialize a dropdown THEN it SHALL use the `PopulationService.populateDropdown` method
3. WHEN the `PopulationManager` needs to select a population THEN it SHALL use the `PopulationService.getPopulationById` method
4. WHEN the `PopulationManager` needs to refresh populations THEN it SHALL use the `PopulationService` methods and clear the cache
5. WHEN the `App` class needs to interact with populations THEN it SHALL use the `PopulationService` or `PopulationManager` methods instead of making direct API calls
6. WHEN any other module needs to interact with populations THEN it SHALL use the `PopulationService` or `PopulationManager` methods

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the `PopulationService` integrates well with existing systems, so that it works seamlessly with the rest of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `PopulationService` needs to make authenticated API calls THEN it SHALL integrate with the existing authentication system
2. WHEN the `PopulationService` needs to make API calls THEN it SHALL integrate with the existing API client
3. WHEN the `PopulationService` needs to update the UI THEN it SHALL integrate with the existing UI manager
4. WHEN the `PopulationService` is tested THEN it SHALL have comprehensive tests in the `test/api/` directory
5. WHEN the `PopulationService` is documented THEN it SHALL have documentation in the `docs/api/` directory

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the `PopulationService` to be extensible, so that it can accommodate future population-related features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new population-related features are needed THEN the `PopulationService` SHALL be easily extensible to accommodate them
2. WHEN the API changes THEN the `PopulationService` SHALL isolate those changes from the rest of the application
3. WHEN the `PopulationService` is designed THEN it SHALL follow the same patterns as other services in the application
4. WHEN the `PopulationService` is implemented THEN it SHALL be modular and have a single responsibility
