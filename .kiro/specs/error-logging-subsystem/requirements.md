# Error Handling and Logging Subsystem Requirements

## Introduction

The PingOne Import Tool currently handles error management and logging in a scattered manner across multiple files, with inconsistent approaches to error formatting, reporting, and recovery. This specification outlines the requirements for a new `ErrorLoggingSubsystem` that will centralize all error handling and logging functionality, providing a robust, maintainable, and future-proof solution.

The `ErrorLoggingSubsystem` will be responsible for capturing, formatting, logging, and reporting errors throughout the application. It will provide consistent error handling patterns, standardized logging levels, and flexible reporting mechanisms. The subsystem will be designed with future extensibility in mind, ensuring that changes to the application won't impact the error handling and logging functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized system for error handling and logging, so that I can maintain consistent error management across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs in any part of the application THEN the `ErrorService` SHALL provide a method to capture and process it
2. WHEN an error needs to be logged THEN the `LoggingService` SHALL provide methods for different logging levels (debug, info, warn, error)
3. WHEN an error needs to be reported to the user THEN the `ErrorReporter` SHALL provide methods to display appropriate messages
4. WHEN the application needs to recover from an error THEN the `ErrorService` SHALL provide recovery strategies
5. WHEN the `ErrorService` is instantiated THEN it SHALL accept dependencies via dependency injection
6. WHEN the `LoggingService` logs messages THEN it SHALL use a consistent format across all logging levels
7. WHEN the `ErrorReporter` displays messages THEN it SHALL use a consistent format and style

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize error handling and logging, so that the application performs efficiently even when errors occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple errors of the same type occur THEN the `ErrorService` SHALL deduplicate them to prevent log flooding
2. WHEN errors are logged THEN the `LoggingService` SHALL use appropriate logging levels to control verbosity
3. WHEN the application is in production mode THEN the `LoggingService` SHALL minimize debug logging
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the `ErrorService` SHALL handle it gracefully without crashing the application
5. WHEN logging is performed THEN the `LoggingService` SHALL use asynchronous operations to avoid blocking the main thread

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update existing code to use the new `ErrorLoggingSubsystem`, so that all error handling and logging is centralized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component needs to log a message THEN it SHALL use the `LoggingService` instead of console methods
2. WHEN any component needs to handle an error THEN it SHALL use the `ErrorService` instead of try-catch blocks
3. WHEN any component needs to report an error to the user THEN it SHALL use the `ErrorReporter` instead of direct UI manipulation
4. WHEN any component needs to recover from an error THEN it SHALL use the `ErrorService` recovery strategies
5. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL initialize the `ErrorLoggingSubsystem` before other components
6. WHEN any module needs to interact with errors or logs THEN it SHALL use the appropriate subsystem components

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the `ErrorLoggingSubsystem` integrates well with existing systems, so that it works seamlessly with the rest of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `LoggingService` needs to write logs THEN it SHALL integrate with the existing file system or logging infrastructure
2. WHEN the `ErrorReporter` needs to display messages THEN it SHALL integrate with the existing UI components
3. WHEN the `ErrorService` needs to handle API errors THEN it SHALL integrate with the existing API client
4. WHEN the `ErrorLoggingSubsystem` is tested THEN it SHALL have comprehensive tests
5. WHEN the `ErrorLoggingSubsystem` is documented THEN it SHALL have thorough documentation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the `ErrorLoggingSubsystem` to be extensible, so that it can accommodate future error handling and logging needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new error types are introduced THEN the `ErrorService` SHALL be easily extensible to handle them
2. WHEN new logging destinations are needed THEN the `LoggingService` SHALL support adding them without modifying existing code
3. WHEN new reporting mechanisms are required THEN the `ErrorReporter` SHALL support adding them without modifying existing code
4. WHEN the application architecture changes THEN the `ErrorLoggingSubsystem` SHALL continue to function without modification
5. WHEN third-party dependencies change THEN the `ErrorLoggingSubsystem` SHALL isolate those changes from the rest of the application

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the `ErrorLoggingSubsystem` to provide useful debugging information, so that I can quickly identify and fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error is logged THEN the `LoggingService` SHALL include contextual information (timestamp, component, severity)
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the `ErrorService` SHALL capture the stack trace and relevant context
3. WHEN a complex operation fails THEN the `ErrorService` SHALL provide detailed information about the failure point
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the `LoggingService` SHALL support configurable verbosity levels
5. WHEN errors are related THEN the `ErrorService` SHALL establish and log the relationships between them

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see helpful error messages, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to proceed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error affects the user THEN the `ErrorReporter` SHALL display a user-friendly message
2. WHEN an error has a known solution THEN the `ErrorReporter` SHALL provide guidance on how to resolve it
3. WHEN an error requires user action THEN the `ErrorReporter` SHALL clearly indicate what action is needed
4. WHEN multiple errors occur THEN the `ErrorReporter` SHALL prioritize and display them appropriately
5. WHEN an error is resolved THEN the `ErrorReporter` SHALL clear or update the error message
