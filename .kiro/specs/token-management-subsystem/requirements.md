# Token Management Subsystem Requirements

## Introduction

The PingOne Import Tool currently handles token management in a scattered manner across multiple files, making it difficult to maintain a consistent approach to authentication, token refresh, and token status display. This specification outlines the requirements for a new `TokenManagementSubsystem` that will centralize all token-related functionality, providing a robust, maintainable, and future-proof solution.

The `TokenManagementSubsystem` will be responsible for token acquisition, validation, refresh, storage, and status display. It will provide a unified interface for token operations and ensure consistent token handling throughout the application. The subsystem will be designed with security best practices in mind and will be resilient to future changes in the authentication flow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized system for token management, so that I can maintain consistent authentication across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application needs to acquire a token THEN the `TokenService` SHALL provide a method to obtain it
2. WHEN a token needs to be validated THEN the `TokenService` SHALL provide a method to check its validity
3. WHEN a token is about to expire THEN the `TokenService` SHALL provide a method to refresh it
4. WHEN a token needs to be stored THEN the `TokenService` SHALL provide secure storage mechanisms
5. WHEN the `TokenService` is instantiated THEN it SHALL accept dependencies via dependency injection
6. WHEN the `TokenService` makes API calls THEN it SHALL use the provided API client
7. WHEN the `TokenService` needs to log events THEN it SHALL use the provided logging service

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize token operations, so that the application performs efficiently and securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a token is requested THEN the `TokenService` SHALL check if a valid token already exists before making an API call
2. WHEN a token is about to expire THEN the `TokenService` SHALL proactively refresh it before it becomes invalid
3. WHEN a token is stored THEN the `TokenService` SHALL use secure storage methods to prevent unauthorized access
4. WHEN a token operation fails THEN the `TokenService` SHALL handle the error gracefully and provide a meaningful error message
5. WHEN multiple components request a token simultaneously THEN the `TokenService` SHALL deduplicate requests to minimize API calls

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update existing code to use the new `TokenManagementSubsystem`, so that all token-related operations are centralized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component needs to get a token THEN it SHALL use the `TokenService` instead of direct API calls
2. WHEN any component needs to check token validity THEN it SHALL use the `TokenService` instead of custom validation logic
3. WHEN any component needs to refresh a token THEN it SHALL use the `TokenService` instead of custom refresh logic
4. WHEN any component needs to store or retrieve a token THEN it SHALL use the `TokenService` instead of direct storage access
5. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL initialize the `TokenManagementSubsystem` before other components that require authentication
6. WHEN any module needs to interact with tokens THEN it SHALL use the appropriate subsystem components

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the `TokenManagementSubsystem` integrates well with existing systems, so that it works seamlessly with the rest of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `TokenService` needs to make API calls THEN it SHALL integrate with the existing API client
2. WHEN the `TokenStatusProvider` needs to display token status THEN it SHALL integrate with the existing UI components
3. WHEN the `TokenService` needs to handle errors THEN it SHALL integrate with the Error Handling and Logging Subsystem
4. WHEN the `TokenManagementSubsystem` is tested THEN it SHALL have comprehensive tests
5. WHEN the `TokenManagementSubsystem` is documented THEN it SHALL have thorough documentation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the `TokenManagementSubsystem` to be extensible, so that it can accommodate future authentication needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication requirements change THEN the `TokenManagementSubsystem` SHALL be easily extensible to handle new token types
2. WHEN token storage requirements change THEN the `TokenService` SHALL support adding new storage mechanisms without modifying existing code
3. WHEN token validation rules change THEN the `TokenValidator` SHALL support adding new validation rules without modifying existing code
4. WHEN the application architecture changes THEN the `TokenManagementSubsystem` SHALL continue to function without modification
5. WHEN third-party dependencies change THEN the `TokenManagementSubsystem` SHALL isolate those changes from the rest of the application

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be informed about token status, so that I can take appropriate action when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a token is about to expire THEN the `TokenStatusProvider` SHALL display a warning to the user
2. WHEN a token has expired THEN the `TokenStatusProvider` SHALL display an error to the user
3. WHEN a token refresh is in progress THEN the `TokenStatusProvider` SHALL display a loading indicator
4. WHEN a token refresh fails THEN the `TokenStatusProvider` SHALL display an error with guidance on how to resolve it
5. WHEN a token is successfully refreshed THEN the `TokenStatusProvider` SHALL display a success message

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want token operations to be transparent, so that I can continue using the application without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a token is being refreshed THEN the application SHALL continue to function normally if possible
2. WHEN a token refresh fails THEN the application SHALL provide clear guidance on how to resolve the issue
3. WHEN a token is required for an operation THEN the application SHALL automatically obtain one if the user is authenticated
4. WHEN a token cannot be obtained automatically THEN the application SHALL prompt the user for authentication
5. WHEN a token operation is in progress THEN the application SHALL provide appropriate feedback to the user
