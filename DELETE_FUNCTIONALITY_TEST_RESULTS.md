- **✅ Found in**: `routes/api/index.js`
- **✅ Endpoint**: `POST /api/delete-users`
- **✅ Features**: File upload, token management, user validation
- **✅ Implementation**: Complete delete workflow with authentication

```javascript
router.post('/delete-users', upload.single('file'), async (req, res) => {
    try {
        debugLog("Delete", "🔄 Delete users request received", {
            hasFile: !!req.file,
            populationId: req.body.populationId,
            type: req.body.type,
            skipNotFound: req.body.skipNotFound
        });
        
        // Token management and authentication
        const tokenManager = req.app.get('tokenManager');
        const token = await tokenManager.getAccessToken();
        const environmentId = await tokenManager.getEnvironmentId();
        // ... complete implementation
    }
});
```
